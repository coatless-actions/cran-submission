# R Package CRAN Submission Action

This GitHub Action automates the process of checking and submitting R packages to CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). 
It performs all necessary checks to ensure your package complies with CRAN policies and then submits it, creating an issue to track the submission status.

You can see a demo of this action in action [here][submit-cran-demo]. 

## Usage

Add this to your repository's workflow:

```yaml
name: Submit to CRAN

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      confirmation:
        description: 'Type "CONFIRM" to proceed with CRAN submission'
        required: true
        default: ''
        type: string
  release:
    types: [prereleased]   # Only trigger on pre-releases


jobs:
  cran-submission:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Submit package to CRAN
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write                # Needed to create issues
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Submit R package to CRAN
        uses: coatless-actions/cran-submission@v1
        with:
          pkg-directory: '.'       # Directory containing the package
          check-directory: 'check' # Directory for check outputs
          error-on: 'warning'      # Fail on warnings
          create-issue: true       # Create issues to track submissions
